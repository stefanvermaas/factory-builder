Factory Builder is a framework agnostic and scalable fixtures replacement for your test suite. It has a straightforward definition syntax, mimics multiple build strategies (unsaved instances and attribute hashes), and it allows you to create multiple factories (variants) for the same instance.

It's heavily inspired by [FactoryBot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/) by [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot).

## Installation
This module is distributed via npm which is bundled with node and should be installed as one of your project's devDependencies:

```shell
// When using NPM
npm install --save-dev factory-builder

// Or when using Yarn
yarn add --dev factory-builder
```

## Examples

### Defining factories
Each factory has a name and a set of attributes. It is highly recommended that you have one factory for each class that provides the simplest set of attributes necessary to create an instance of that class.

Note that the factory is an `Object` with the `attributes` key. The value of this `attributes` key can either be a function that returns an `Object` or an `Object`.

```js
// ./factories/User.js
const User = {
  attributes: {
    firstName: 'Thom',
    lastName: 'Taylor',
    email: 'example@example.org',
  }
}

export default User;
```

#### Lazily evaluate the attributes

Most of the time, defining the `attributes` as a object on the factory will be enough. However, the `attributes` can also be defined as a function. This is useful for when one wants to assign a dynamic value to any of the attributes.

```js
// ./factories/User.js
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'; // NOTE: The `uuid` library is not part of Factory Builder.

const User = {
  attributes: () => ({
    id: uuid(),
    firstName: 'Thom',
    lastName: 'Taylor',
    email: 'example@example.org',
  })
}

export default User;
```

### Consuming factories

On it's own there is nothing special about factories. They're just plain javascript object that return a specifically styled object. To actually use the factory in your test you can make use of multiple methods that are provided by Factory Buider;

- `build`: builds a single, new factory.
- `buildList`: builds a given number of factories.
- `attributesFor`: returns the attributes of a factory.

#### Building a new factory with `build`.

Factory Builder doesn't depend on any database, which makes it easy to quickly run your entire test suite. The `build` simple creates a new factory.

```js
// ./specs/User.js
import { build } from 'factory-builder';
import User from './factories/User';

describe('User', () => {
  it('builds a new user', () => {
    const user = build(User, { lastName: 'build' });
    expect(user.lastName).toEqual('build');
    expect(user.id).toBeUndefined();
  });
});
```

#### Building multiple factories with `buildList`.

You can also create multiple factories at the same time. For this you can use the `buildList` functions that the Factory Builder package provides.

```js
// ./specs/User.js
import { buildList } from 'factory-builder';
import User from './factories/User';

describe('User', () => {
  it('builds 2 new users', () => {
    const users = buildList(User, 2, { lastName: 'build' });
    expect(users.length).toEqual(2);
  });
});
```

#### Building multiple factories with different attributes

In addition to passing an object with attributes, it's also possible to pass an array to `buildList` in order to use different values for  multiple factories.

```js
// ./specs/User.js
import { buildList } from 'factory-builder';
import User from './factories/User';

describe('User', () => {
  it('builds 2 new users with different values', () => {
    const users = buildList(User, 2, [{ lastName: 'build' }, { lastName: 'something' }]);
    expect(users.length).toEqual(2);
    expect(users[0].lastName).toEqual('build');
    expect(users[1].lastName).toEqual('something');
  });
});
```

### Before and after hooks

It's also possible to use one of the hooks that Factory Builder provides for injecting some code;

- `beforeBuild` - called before building the factory
- `afterBuild` - called after building the factory

These methods can be globally defined on your factory or can be passed to the  `build` method. These hooks enable you to modify or use create data to do whatever you want. The `before*` and `after*` methods should always return an `Object` and they always have one argument: the attributes of the factory.

```js
// ./factories/User.js
const User = {
  attributes: {
    firstName: 'Peter',
  },

  beforeBuild: (attributes) => {
    return {
      ...attributes,
      lastName: `${attributes.firstName}s`,
    };
  },

  afterBuild: (attributes) => {
    return {
      ...attributes,
      email: `${attributes.firstName}@email.org`,
    };
  },
};

export default User;
```

> **NOTE:** It's currently not possible to pass the `beforeBuild` and `afterBuild` to either the `build` or `buildList` method. These hooks should be defined on the `Factory` itself.

### Using variants

Variants enable you to define multiple variants of the same base factory. You can use the `as` key when you create or build a factory and it will return the variant you've defined.

```js
const User = {
  attributes: {
    firstName: 'Peter',
    isClient: false,
    isAdmin: false,
  },
  variants: {
    admin: {
      isClient: false,
      isAdmin: true,
    },
    client: {
      isClient: true,
    }
  }
};

import { build } from 'factory-builder';
build(User, as: 'admin'); // => { firstName: 'Peter', isClient: false, isAdmin: true };
```

> **NOTE:** The variant must be a plain object and should be namespaced in your factory under `variants`. The key name will also be the way you pick this specific factory variant.

The attributes of a specific variant can also be lazily evaluated. Just like the regular attributes of a Factory. To make use of the lazy evaluation, use a function that returns an object.

```js
import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid'; // NOTE: The `uuid` library is not part of Factory Builder.

const User = {
  attributes: {
    firstName: 'Peter',
  },

  variants: {
    created: () => ({ id: uuid() })
  }
};

import { build } from 'factory-builder';
build(User, as: 'created'); // => { firstName: 'Peter', id: '9b1deb4d-3b7d-4bad-9bdd-2b0d7b3dcb6d' };
```

#### Quickly grab the attributes with `attributesFor`.

Want to quickly get all the attributes for a factory (for example to use it as POST data in your tests), you can use the `attributesFor` method. This will return an object with all the attributes of a factory.

```js
// ./specs/User.js
import { attributesFor } from 'factory-builder';
import User from './factories/User';

describe('User', () => {
  it('sends an API request', () => {
    const userData = attributesFor(User, { lastName: 'Moses' });

    const response = FakeApi('/some-url', {
      method: 'POST',
      body: JSON.stringify(userData),
    });

    expect(response.lastName).toEqual('Moses');
  });
});
```

> **NOTE:** The `attributesFor` doesn't call the `beforeBuild` and `afterBuild` hooks for the factory.

### Generating data (optional)

You could use a third party library like [fakerjs](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to create fake data for your factories or just define it yourself.

### Using with a ORM
If you want to persist your factory built objects in order to test the actual creation in a database, it's possible with `afterBuild`.
Here is an example with Sequelize where `db` has been defined globally for test purposes. We're calling Sequelize's `create` function with the  object attributes in the `afterBuild` method.

```js
const User = {
  attributes: {
    firstName: 'Thom',
    lastName: 'Taylor',
    email: 'example@example.org',
  },

  afterBuild: async (attributes) => global.db.user.create(attributes),
};
```
Build the factory and await the created database entity and test it.
```js
const user = await build(User);
expect(user.firstName).toEqual('Thom');
```
